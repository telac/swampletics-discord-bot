Probably one of the more useless bots ever made for discord. I have also never made a discord bot before.

### requirements

`requests` and `discord.py`

### installation

clone this repository, create a `conf.ini` file that contains the following:
```
[swampletics]
token=<your-token-goes-here>
```

### How to run:

`./swamp_bot.py`


### Screenshots

![screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot")

### other stuff

the latest video needs to actually be manually changed in `helpers.py`. There are no plans to use this bot for any duration longer than one evening so I guess that's that.
